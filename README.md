# Browser Game

explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

Technologies Used
  1. Javascript
  2. HTML5 (Canvas)
  3. CSS

Approach

This project took multiple approaches, many of which failed and had to be scrapped. The overall goal was to create a game in which the user must dodge the objects on the screen through the movement of the mouse. The major points as well as the order I approached this project were:
  1. Creating a way to detect the coordinates of the mouse as well as mouse movement through event listeners.
  2. Assign properties to all objects, most importantly to keep track of their positions as they are animated across the          screen.
  3. Using canvas draw properties to give the illusion of animation.
  4. Assigning multiple conditions, that is, the game ends either when the mouse object leaves the canvas or collides with a moving object.

Unsolved Problems
  1. Canvas is a work in progress and I am still attempting to learn the details and as such it was hard to incorporate         responsive design. I worked mostly in full screen mode and thus any change in the screen size will distort the             positioning as well as the mouse input. 
  2. As of now, I have not yet created a check for collision detection. It seems there are multiple areas that effect what      happens when the mouse collides with an object.
  3. Site is not responsive. Needs a major reworking of CSS.
